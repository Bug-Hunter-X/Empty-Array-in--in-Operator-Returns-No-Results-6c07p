This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in MongoDB queries using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents, as an empty array should logically match nothing, thereby including everything. However, MongoDB interprets this as an explicit 'no match' condition resulting in an empty result set. The solution provided addresses this behavior.
